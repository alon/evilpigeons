Evil Pigeons
============

A 2-player game between an evil pigeon master that controls the pigeons, who wish to shit-load a fancy car, and a mad car owner who wishes to exterminate the nasty pigeons before they succeed.

Installing Prerequisites
========================

Python version: The game was tested with python 2.6.4, but should work with 2.4 and above.

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-pygame

Linux (non ubuntu): install the python-pygame package

Window:
 get python and install: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.4/python-2.6.4.msi
 get pygame and install: http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.6.msi

Mac OS X:
 Untested. Should work fine since pygame is known to be supported on it.

Running
=======

Linux and Mac: ./run.sh
Windows: run.bat (or just run)

Game play
=========

Mad car owner: Mouse to move cursor, button to shoot. You can't kill a perched pigeon. Notice the lag between shots.
Piegons: keypad 1-4 to dive shit, keypad 1-4 and shift to mimic a dive without actually diving.
