Evil Pigeons
============

A 2-player game between an evil pigeon master that controls the pigeons, who wish to shit-load a fancy car, and a mad car owner who wishes to exterminate the nasty pigeons before they succeed.

Running from release
====================
A prebuilt binary is supplied for windows only for lack of resources and ease of installing required packages on linux (we didn't have access or time to access a mac).

The windows directory contains a single exe called "main.exe". Running it will run in fullscreen.

Game play
=========

Mad car owner: Mouse to move cursor, button to shoot. You can't kill a perched pigeon. Notice the lag between shots.
Piegons: keypad 1-4 to dive shit, keypad 1-4 and shift to mimic a dive without actually diving.

Command line parameters
=======================
Wether running from the exe or from run.sh / run.bat you can use the following command line parameters:
--window	run in windowed mode
--nomusic	run without the background music track (but with the birds flaps track and sounds)

Development options:
--setpos	run in a special setup mode (requires json)
